# In-memory-Boolean-Computation-inside-10T-SRAM-Cells
## Abstract
The von Neumann computing architecture has been the workhorse for virtually all the computing systems for last several decades. However, it faces serious issues of memory wall problem with the ever increasing demand of data intensive computing systems. To mitigate this bottleneck, one of the approach that researchers have come up is to enable inmemory Boolean computation. In this work, we will present the circuits and underlying principle behind in-memory computation inside SRAM cells.
## Keywords
von Neumann, in-memory computing, SRAM cells.
## 1. Introduction
The von-Neumann architecture [1], characterized by different computing cores and memory storage, widely covers a wide range of computer architecture used in today’s 
world. This leads to the in famous von-Neumann bottleneck problem [2] while driving data intensive tasks such artificial intelligence, neural networks, etc. on chip. This is due to repeated and huge data relocation between computing and memory cores which are at physically separate location on the chip. This leads to both latency and large energy overheads limiting the throughput of the system.
